# Mobile First

Mobile first is a best practice in both design and development. With the mobile take over well underway, it is more important than ever that we consider mobile from the earliest stages of development. 

The basic idea behind mobile first is that you design (or develop) a mobile version of your site or app before creating the desktop version. 

## Why Mobile First?

- Forces you to focus. You can only display so much on a mobile screen at one time. What are the most important things that you need to show?
- Mobile tends to have slower download speeds. Are you thinking about waht your page looks like with images / media missing? Do you really need to make your mobile user download all that extra data? Some people still have limited data use / pay per mb used. 
- Mobile has different capabilities and constraints that should be given consideration from the beginning, not just as an afterthought.
