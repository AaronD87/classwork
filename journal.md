
Create a repo to hold all of your learning journal entries. You will add a new entry each day. Each entry should be a formatted markdown file with the following "frontmatter"

```md
---
path: "/blog/day-1-getting-started"
date: "2018-10-22"
title: "Day 1 - Getting started"
tags: ["HTML", "CSS", "Layouts", "Positioning", "Floats"]
---

<!-- Markdown formatted content goes here -->
```

Later on in the career track, we will do a project on building your portfolio. You can use these learning journal entries to create a blog about your learning journey. The frontmatter content at the beginning of each post plus the markdown formatting will be translated into nicely formatted and styled pages that can be filtered or searched by date and tags.
